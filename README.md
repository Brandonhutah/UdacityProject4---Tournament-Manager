Project 4 - Tournament Database

What is it?
-------------
This project deals with using a relational database to keep track of players and matches played, and pairs players for matches based on their current standings.

To Run
-------------
To run this app, first make sure you have a linux distribution with PSQL installed. After that's done, run the tournament.sql file in your linux box to make sure the proper database and tables are created, you can use the command 'psql -f tournament.sql'.

After that's finished you can run the tournament_test.py file to run tests against the tournament.py file I have written using the command 'python tournament_test.py' while your command line is in the directory that contains that file.
